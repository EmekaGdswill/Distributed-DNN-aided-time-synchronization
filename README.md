This is the Python repository for the paper "Deep Learning Aided Distributed Clock Synchronization for Wireless Networks"
//The code obtains network clock synchronization for wireless sensor nodes via pulse coupled PLLs at the nodes
Please cite our paper, if the code is used for publishing research.
